  XKCD-Source-Plugin Example
</h1>

This example is based on [Gatsby's hello-world starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world) which ships with the main Gatsby configuration files but is designed to make it straightforward to see how to use the `gatsby-source-xkcd` plugin!

## ðŸš€ Quick start

Navigate into the `example` folder (that's where this README is located) and start it up.

    ```shell
    $ gatsby develop
    ```

## What's different from the Gatsby Starter?

The only configuration this example has _beyond_ the Gatsby `hello-world` starter is the plugin for XKCD and a page which renders the latest comic (`src/index.js`).

## ðŸŽ“ Learning Gatsby
