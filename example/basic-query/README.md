  XKCD-Source-Plugin Example
</h1>

This example is based on [Gatsby's hello-world starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world) which ships with the main Gatsby configuration files but is designed to make it straightforward to see how to use the `gatsby-source-xkcd` plugin!

This example demonstrates the using the `gatsby-source-xkcd` plugin with some basic queries for:
1. The latest XKCD comic
1. Two specific comics
1. Three random comics

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Navigate into the `example` folder (that's where this README is located)
2. Make sure the dependencies are installed (`npm install` or `yarn install`)
3. Start it up

    ```shell
    $ npm start
    ```

At this point you should have a Gatsby site running locally at `localhost:8000`!

## What's different from the Gatsby Starter?

The only configuration this example has _beyond_ the Gatsby `hello-world` starter is the plugin for XKCD (in `gatsby-config.js`) and a page which renders the comics (`src/index.js`).
